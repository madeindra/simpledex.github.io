# simpledex.github.io
Simple browser for mangadex v5 pictures and manga

Site is up at [simpledex.github.io](https://simpledex.github.io)

This project is meant to be a temporary way for accessing mangadex content before their official tools have been completed. There are no plans to make this anything bigger than a browser. That means there will not be any user log-in features, bookmarks or collections implemented.

**Note! All images received** using this site are downloaded **directly from mangadex servers to the user, by the user**. This site only provides a way for using the API. No image content is hosted in this repository.

**Note 2!** Current Mangadex v5 APIs are in open beta. There could be bugs in the APIs, just as well as in this project.
